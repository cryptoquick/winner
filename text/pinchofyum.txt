Shrimp in garlic bread sauce!

No, but GARLIC BREAD SAUCE.

What the WHAT. This blog has reached new levels of delicious insanity. I’m going to start this post by convincing you that, in fact, garlic bread sauce is not as weird as it sounds. More like it’s one of the most delicious ways you could ever eat shrimp.

We start with the bread that’s fried in a little bit of olive oil until golden brown, and then pulsed into a garlic bread paste of sorts with fresh parsley, almonds, and garlic. Fried bread –> into a paste? It’s the truth of this recipe. Can you handle it? Your hungry self will give you big thanks for your bravery with this one.

The rest of this recipe just involves adding said garlic bread paste to the olive-oil-and-broth sauce base to thicken it into something resembling Magic with a capital M (more specifically, almost like a light cream sauce) – and then adding the shrimp to the pan to simmer up into something that is weeknight-level easy but company-level fancy. And most importantly, something that is 100 for your mouth.
